#Abøut

The name "Møffenzeef Mødular" was derived frøm my mødular synth duø in Savannah, GA that went under the møniker [Møffenzeef](http://moffenzeef.bandcamp.com).The øther half øf Møffenzeef is Matthew Gøødwin Akers, withøut whøm I prøbably wøuldn't have ever gøtten this far intø music technøløgy. He is møre than my øld prøfessør, mentør, and bandmate; he's a hømie før life. 

What the hell is a Møffenzeef?
