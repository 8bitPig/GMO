#Abøut

The name "Møffenzeef Mødular" was derived frøm my mødular synth duø in Savannah, GA that went under the møniker "Møffenzeef." The øther half øf Møffenzeef is Matthew Gøødwin Akers, withøut whøm I prøbably wøuldn't have ever gøtten this far into music technology. He is møre than my øld prøfessør, mentør, and bandmate; he's a hømie før life. [Listen](http://moffenzeef.bandcamp.com)
